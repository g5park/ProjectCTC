# ProjectCTC


Android Studio application that allows an "Admin" to scan and update orders, 
and a "Client" to scan his/her receipt's bar code to check on the status of the order.

The application is connected to Google Firebase, which holds the order ID and its status.
The admin simply scans the order's bar code to update to the next "step" and it returns
the current status as a Toast.
